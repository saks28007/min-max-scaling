# EXP 4 : Min-Max Scaling.
This repository provides code and results for Min-Max Scaling in data preprocessing. It covers dataset normalization to enhance model performance and interpretability. The project includes examples, visualizations, and comparisons with other scaling techniques, along with best practices and common pitfalls for effective real-world application.

# Experiment Overview
# Steps:
**1. Import required libraries :** *Load the necessary libraries for performing Min-Max Scaling and handling numerical data.*
<br>
**2. Create a NumPy Array (Dataset) :** *Define a numerical dataset as a 2D array, ensuring compatibility with scaling techniques.*
<br>
**3. Initialize MinMaxScaler with Feature Range (0,1) :** *Initialize a scaler that transforms data by mapping its values within a specified range, typically enhancing consistency for machine learning models.*
<br>
**4. Apply Min-Max Scaling to the Data :** *Scale the dataset by normalizing each value based on the minimum and maximum values, ensuring all data points fall within the specified range.*
<br>
**5. Print the Scaled Data :** *Output the transformed dataset, displaying the normalized values after applying Min-Max Scaling.*
